## Exercise 1
The clean code principles that I've applied in this module:
* Clear and self-explanatory variable names
* Clear and self-explanatory function names
* The lack of necessity for comments as the code is already clear enough
* No null returned
* Production is executed using branch workflow and with no trunking

This is not so much a mistake as it is a lack of feature, but there needs to be an authentication and authorization system in order to regulate who can manipulate and delete products
